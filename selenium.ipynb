       "Vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) has been shown to be responsible for maturation of various seed proteins in protein-storage vacuoles. *Arabidopsis* has three VPE homologues; βVPE is specific to seeds and αVPE and γVPE are specific to vegetative organs. To investigate the activity of the vegetative VPE, we expressed the γVPE in a *pep4* strain of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and found that γVPE has the ability to cleave the peptide bond at the carbonyl side of asparagine residues. An immunocytochemical analysis revealed the specific localization of the γVPE in the lytic vacuoles of *Arabidopsis* leaves that had been treated with wounding. These findings indicate that γVPE functions in the lytic vacuoles as the βVPE does in the protein-storage vacuoles. The βVPE promoter was found to direct the expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene in seeds and the root tip of transgenic *Arabidopsis* plants. On the other hand, both the αVPE and γVPE promoters directed the expression in senescent tissues, but not in young intact tissues. The mRNA levels of both *αVPE* and *γVPE* were increased in the primary leaves during senescence in parallel with the increase of the mRNA level of a senescence-associated gene (*SAG2*). Treatment with wounding, ethylene and salicylic acid up-regulated the expression of *αVPE* and *γVPE*, while jasmonate slightly up-regulated the expression of *γVPE*. These gene expression patterns of the *VPEs* were associated with the accumulation of vacuolar proteins that are known to respond to these treatments. Taken together, the results suggest that vegetative VPE might regulate the activation of some functional proteins in the lytic vacuoles.\n",

       "In higher plants, seed proteins are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum as proprotein precursors and then transported to protein-storage vacuoles via precursor-accumulating (PAC) vesicles ( [Hara-Nishimura *et al*. 1998a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00497.x/#b1) ). The precursors are proteolytically processed to make their respective mature forms in the vacuoles. We have found an enzyme responsible for maturation of various storage proteins in the protein-storage vacuoles of maturing seeds and have designated it vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) (\n",

The VPE-mediated maturation system for seed proteins has been well characterized, as described above. A similar VPE-mediated system could be involved in maturation of vacuolar proteins in the vegetative vacuoles to acquire and maintain their active functions of vacuoles. To address this possibility, it is necessary to clarify when and where the vegetative VPEs are expressed in order for them to function in the lytic vacuoles. Here we demonstrate the enzyme activity and subcellular localization of vegetative γVPE of *Arabidopsis*, and show the temporal and spatial expression of the vegetative *VPE* genes.
